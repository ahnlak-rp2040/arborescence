# Arborescence

Another demo for the PicoVision; this time exploring the C(++) API instead of
MicroPython.

This simply renders some randomly generated line trees, which slowly fade over
time; we use a full colour mode for this, rather than palettes, and don't make
much use of the hardware sprites & scrolling that are available.
